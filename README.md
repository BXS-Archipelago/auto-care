==============-The Auto Care Page by Brian Smyth-================

===== -Introduction- ====

*Overview*

This website is for any car owner who wishes to keep their car looking new through the provision of expert information and instructions. 

*Why does it exist?*

The most critical aspect of owning a car is rapid depreciation in value. Apart from essential mechanical maintenance, keeping the car in good condition will ensure a faster resale for greater value. 

*What does it do?*

The site will contain important information about processes, techniques for care, chemicals to use and also information about what to avoid. 

*How does it work?*

The site will contain several pages dedicated to the different areas of a car since each must be treated very differently.
